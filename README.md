- 👋 Hi, I’m @MotherCrow, a creative writer, artist, and teacher. 
- 🌻 I am interested in poetry, performance, art, education, child development, personality patterns and disorders, neurodivergence, yoga, and sustainability practices.  
- ☀️ I am currently learning Adobe Creative Suite, the bird of paradise pose, and how to start a business.  
- ✍️ I am looking to collaborate on projects in need of a creative consultant or line/developmental editor.
- 🌟I am highly detail-oriented and uniquely capable of understanding another perosn's vision.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am allergic to coffee and beer, and chocolate makes me gag. Most people can't wrap their heads around such absurdity.
