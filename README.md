- 👋 Hi, I’m @MotherCrow, a creative writer/artist/teacher/mother of two.
- 👀 I’m interested in poetry, performance, art, education, child development, personality patterns and disorders, neurodivergence, yoga, and sustainability practices.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Adobe Creative Suite, the bird of paradise pose, and how to start a business.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in need of a creative consultant or line/developmental editor.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am allergic to coffee and beer, and chocolate makes me gag. Most people can't wrap their heads around such absurdity.
