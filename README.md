- 👋 Hello, I’m @MotherCrow
- 🌻 My special interests are poetry, performance art, hot yoga, child development, mental health, personality disorders, neurodivergence, education & curriculum development, community health & wellness, and sustainability practices.  
- ☀️ I am currently learning Adobe Creative Suite, Bird of Paradise, and how to start a non-profit organization.  
- ✍️ I am looking to collaborate on projects in need of creative input, a line editor, or a developmental editor.
- 🌟 I am notably detail-oriented and uniquely capable of understanding another person's vision. 
- 🤝 To Grow with Mother Crow, please visit wwww.mothercrowpoetry.com
- 🪝 Reading my poetry may result in emotional whiplash, but the prose that follows is always crisp, logical, and expertly crafted. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am allergic to coffee and beer, and chocolate makes me gag. Most people can't wrap their heads around such an absurd palette.
